-- -- -- 2. Setting up New Database for Assessment Exercises

-- -- -- Restoring Exercises Database 
-- 
-- We will use a new database for a set of exercise questions.
-- This database has a public and cd schema. 
-- This means the queries for the FROM 
-- tables will have cd. in front of them, for example:
-- -- SELECT * FROM cd.bookings
-- -- SELECT * FROM cd.facilities 

--

SELECT * FROM cd.facilities

--

SELECT * FROM cd.bookings

--

SELECT * FROM cd.members
